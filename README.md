DocketMinder
===============

DocketMinder is a tool to help lawyers who practice in New Orleans to keep track of changes to the web-based
case minute entries provided by the [Orleans Parish Sheriff's Office](http://opcso.org). You can see
it in action [here](http://loyolalawtech.org/docketminder).  DocketMinder uses a simple diff call 
to check for the changes and notify the user via email.  The project uses many open source
tools including:

* [Fat-Free Framework](https://github.com/bcosca/fatfree)
* [HTML5 Boilerplate](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate)
* [Twitter Bootstrap](https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap.git)
* [Initializr](http://www.initializr.com/)

This project was created as a part of the [Litigation and Technology Clinic](http://loyolalawtech.org) of 
[Loyola College of Law, New Orleans](http://law.loyno.edu).
